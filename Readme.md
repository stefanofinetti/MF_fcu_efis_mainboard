# FCU Mainboard

This repositories contains the complete FCU Mainboard project.
* STL Files for 3D Printing, along with the .3mf files for multicolor printing
* SKP Files from SketchUp, if you want to edit dimensions or change anything
* Kicad files for editing the PCB or changing components

## Features
