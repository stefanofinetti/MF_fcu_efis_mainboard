# FCU Mainboard

This repositories contains the complete FCU Mainboard project.
* STL Files for 3D Printing, along with the .3mf files for multicolor printing
* SKP Files from SketchUp, if you want to edit dimensions or change anything
* Kicad files for editing the PCB or changing components

## Features
- If you decide to not modify anything, you can just print the various 3D components and order the PCB from JLCPCB.
- You will need a lot of materials, if you open the Kicad Project you can obtain the BOM directly from it.
- You will need to build your own custom firmware (source provided) or you can use the one in the ZIP file inside the \_dist directory in VsCode Files

## License

This code and all the items are release under GPLv3.0 license. Feel free to use as you wish as long as you redistribute the source code.
It would be nice a mention, though, if you use this work. I invested a good amount of hours just to make it for the amazing MobiFlight community.
